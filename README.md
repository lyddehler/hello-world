# hello-world
My name is Lydia! I am a graphic design major and marketing minor at Emmanuel. I love design and I'm excited to see what I'll learn in this class. I've made a few websites, but all of them were using wordpress. There are some simple coding things you do to personalize pages but not nearly as much required to do this.
