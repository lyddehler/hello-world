# hello-world
My name is Lydia! I am a graphic design major and marketing minor at Emmanuel. I love design and I'm excited to see what I'll learn in this class. I've made a few websites, but all of them were using Wordpress. There is a little bit of coding to do when using Wordpress, but not nearly as much as this.
<H3>Here are some websites I made with Wordpress!</H3>
