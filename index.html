<H4>My name is Lydia!</H4>
<p>I am a graphic design major and marketing minor at Emmanuel. I love design and I'm excited to see what I'll learn in this class. I've made a few websites, but all of them were using Wordpress. There is a little bit of coding to do when using Wordpress, but not nearly as much as this.</p>
<H3>Here are some websites I made with Wordpress!</H3>
<p><a href="http://coastalmainecockapoos.org">Coastal Maine Cockapoos</a></p>
<p><a href="https://vividlyinspiredart.wordpress.com/">My art page</a></p>
<p><a href="https://streetsmartdevice.wordpress.com/">A page I made for my marketing class project</a></p>
<p><H3>Aside from graphic design, I also love drawing and painting! You can check some of that out in the second link I gave if you want(because I can't remember how to insert images on here). See you all in class!<H3><p>
